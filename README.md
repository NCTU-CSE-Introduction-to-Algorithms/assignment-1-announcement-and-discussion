# assignment-1-announcement-and-discussion
Repo for assignment 1 announcement and discussion.

## Filename format
As we have 3 programs in this assignment, please name you file as:
 - `Prog-1.c`
 - `Prog-2.c`
 - `Prog-3.c`

If you don't write in C, C++ is also acceptable, just replace the extension `.c` with `.cpp`, please don't seperate your program to multiple header and class files, only one file for each program.

## Commit requirement
Please **at least** commit each program for **two** commits, don't do them all in a single commit.

## Performance comparison
Please write your performance comparison in file `README.md`(Just like this [README.md](https://github.com/NCTU-CSE-Introduction-to-Algorithms/assignment-1-announcement-and-discussion/blob/master/README.md)) with [Markdown](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/Markdown) format, you should tell us the time spent of each method, and also the difference of the results.

If you are not familiar with Markdown, [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor) is a good markdown online editor for the beginners, GitHub also provides online editor.

## Input / Output

We use standart input and standard output to as the input of the programs, not file.

The inputs will be multiple numbers that be seperated by space, tab or newline character, and end  with a `x` alphabet, there will be at most 10000 inputs.

Here is an example of the input:
`10 5 3 6 5 8 50 564 -1 54 0 2 x`

The corresponding output should be:
`-1 0 2 3 5 5 6 8 10 50 54 564`

## Compilation requirement
Your program should be compatible with GCC v4.8.x or 4.9.x, FYI, you can use [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) v5.11 with TDM-GCC v4.9.2 on Windows.
